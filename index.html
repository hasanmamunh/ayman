                Bachelor of Business Administration IBA, University of Dhaka My lessons at IBA started in the classrooms and grew into something much bigger- what started off as business hacks from the teachers grew into life and survival hacks from my friends. I participated in numerous competitions, won a few, lost many, and learnt a lot- especially from the failures. The wins taught me the result of hard work, and the losses turned out to be chances to improve and adapt.
